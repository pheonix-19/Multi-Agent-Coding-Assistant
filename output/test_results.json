    "Based on the test results, it appears that there are issues with each function written for student data management. Here are my suggestions to correct the issues:",
    "",
    "1. **Add Student - Basic Functionality** and **Add Student - Duplicate Name**:",
    "As per the logic of the \"add_student\" function, a same name student is considered as a duplicate. This might be problematic as different students can have the same name. I'd suggest to change this logic and make 'id' the parameter that is set as UNIQUE in the database, which would eliminate duplicates by ID rather than by name. Also have a check if the data types of age and grade are as expected before inserting them into the database.",
    "",
    "2. **Update Student - Basic Functionality** and **Update Student - Invalid ID**:",
    "Currently, there is no check whether the provided 'student_id' really exists in the database or not. An error will occur if a non-existing ID is used. Add a check to handle this situation elegantly. Also have a check if the data types of age, name and grade are as expected before updating them into the database.",
    "",
    "3. **Search Student - Basic Functionality** and **Search Student - Non-existent Name**:",
    "Similarly, you should add functionality to handle the case where the searched name does not exist in the database. Although the function already handles for this case, make sure that the message \"Student not found!\" is interpreted as a successful test case, rather than a failure.",
    "",
    "4. **Display All Students - Basic Functionality**:",
    "It seems that all students are not getting displayed probably because there are no students in the database at the moment when the test cases are run. Make sure that the database is populated with some test data before this test case is run.",
    "",
    "Testing and debugging will be required to precisely fix the issues as it's hard to diagnose exactly what is causing these specific tests to fail without more information. Placing some print statements in critical areas may assist to debug the code effectively and easily."
